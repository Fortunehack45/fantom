## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey a mysterious and sophisticated tone. This color supports the phantom theme without being overly literal.
- Background color: Dark grey (#222222), enhancing the depth and focus on content, complementing the indigo without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: Electric violet (#8F00FF), used for interactive elements and highlights, providing a jolt of energy that mirrors the competitive spirit of eSports. The brightness and saturation sets it apart.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to combine a futuristic edge with readability.
- Clean, single-column layout optimized for readability, with clear section divisions to emulate a professional guidebook.
- Use subtle, stylized icons related to gaming and esports for section markers. For the phantom theme, consider translucent, layered ghost icons.
- Subtle fade-in or slide-in animations for section transitions.
